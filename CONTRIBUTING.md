# Contributing to git-sitemap

First, thank you for being interested in this project. ðŸŽ‰

We think not only fixing the code but also reporting issues is needed for improving this project.
So we introduce about the example way of conntributing.

## What should I get start from?

First, it is awesome if you try using git-sitemap, and discover improvement points.
And, please report issues or send pull requests.

## How to report issues

You can report issues (e.g. bugs, requests, questions) via GitHub.
We recommend to use labels to judge the type of issues easily.

## How to develop and send pull requests

You can test git-sitemap at this repository. [example-static-site](https://github.com/Hato6502/example-static-site)
Before sending the pull request, we recommend to unify the code styles.

So please install [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh), [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/),
and install the node packages by `npm install` at the repository root directory.
Then the code is checked automatically before `git commit`.
